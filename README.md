# Improved data dump

This was hastily written by me in some sloppy Python code to get something out 
the door. 

It takes the [leaked Fortigate IPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-configs-and-vpn-credentials-for-15-000-fortigate-devices/) and grabs the AS number/owner and geo data for each. Let me know if there's any issues.

I've included the rough script for those curious. It can be adapted for your 
own uses. Note the code is pretty crappy and the exception handling is subpar/broken-ish.
